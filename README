Yeah so this is a very early, tired, and bad attempt at this. It's really messy since I wanted the code to follow my
actual logic as I solve Sudoku puzzles, but the more I learn the more I realize that there are better strategies out
there. And so I'm likely going to re-write and streamline most of this, since it's filled with bad practices.
